Solutions to Harvard's CS50 (2020) PSETs

The following github repository contains the solution to Harvard's CS50 (2020) problem sets.
This includes the solutions for the tracks, namely, Games, Mobile (iOS & Android), and Web.
Participants/students of CS50 are encouraged to try out the problem sets (PSETs) themselves before attempting to seek help.
If this has helped you in some way, please leave a star :)
Would love to know if my codes can be improved in any way, thank you in advance!

### Acknowledgements 
Thank you Prof David Malan and the student instructors involved in providing us with top-notch lecture content, creating the assignments, and the extremely thoughtful walkthrough of each assignment. I have learnt so much from CS50 and 10/10 would recommend it to anyone. This has been one of my most rewarding learning experience ever.
